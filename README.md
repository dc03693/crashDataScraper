# DeliverySystem
Database Project for a Delivery System

This was a group project for CSCI 5432 - Database.  The topic given to our group was Roles-Based Access Control (RBAC).
The application interacts with the DeliverySystem database which emulates a delivery company consisting of Employees,
Vans, and Packages.  While the database handles delivery and driver historical data, the application allows the following
functionality to the user (based on the user's current role):

Administrators - Add employees, vans, and packages.

Managers - Assign drivers to vans and packages to vans.

Drivers - Update package status and print delivery report.

I served as team lead on this project.  My coding contributions included:
fmAdmin, fmManager, fmDriver, fmDriverPackages, fmDelReport.
