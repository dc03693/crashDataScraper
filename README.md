#crashDataScraper
Project for the Bio-Statistics Department

This project was to scrape crash statistic data from a website for the Georgia Southern University's Bio-Statistics Department.  The Windows Form Application uses a webbrowser control to automatically change the values of the website's variables, waits for a response and then copies the results into a tesxt file.

# DeliverySystem
Database Project for a Delivery System

This was a group project for CSCI 5432 - Database.  The topic given to our group was Roles-Based Access Control (RBAC).
The application interacts with the DeliverySystem database which emulates a delivery company consisting of Employees,
Vans, and Packages.  While the database handles delivery and driver historical data, the application allows the following
functionality to the user (based on the user's current role):

Administrators - Add employees, vans, and packages.

Managers - Assign drivers to vans and packages to vans.

Drivers - Update package status and print delivery report.

I served as team lead on this project.  My coding contributions included:
fmAdmin, fmManager, fmDriver, fmDriverPackages, fmDelReport.
